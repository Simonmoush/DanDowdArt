========================================

I'm having trouble hosting the site locally (wordpress gives a fatal error because it says mysql_connect() is undefined)

I think there might be a couple potential causes or simultaneous issues:
	1) the local mysql db doesn't have the same creds and db tables as the server
	2) the wordpress installation on the server is a little out of date
	3) the mariadb service isn't running on my local machine
		I don't know what that service is supposed to do
